# Movie-Trailer-Website

This Movie Trailer Website grabs all the movie information from [OMDb API](http://omdbapi.com/) and displayed the details of the movie in a static web page. If you hover on a particular movie it displays all the movie detils from OMDb Api like Director, Plot, Runtime, Genre, Box-Office. Also it allows us to click on a Movie Poster so that you can view its trailer. I have used Python to gather all the requied information from OMDb API and the presented the webpage using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
